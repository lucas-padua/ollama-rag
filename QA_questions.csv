1,"dometriosis 9 has proven useful in routine clinical practice; it takes into account the concept of a single
disease entity.
In decreasing order of frequency, the following are involved: pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, uterosacral
ligaments, rectovaginal septum/vaginal fornix, and extragenital sites (e.g., rectosigmoid colon and uri‐
nary bladder).
The incidence of involvement of the uterus (adenomyosis) and tubes is not entirely clear. The diaphrag‐
matic peritoneum 137, 
155, the vermiform appendix 71 and the umbilicus 197 are rare but typical extra‐
genital sites. Endometriosis also occurs in surgical scars following hysterectomy, cesarean section, epi‐
siotomy, and perineal lacerations 19, 
62, 
144, 
167. It is debated that this may be caused by the mechani‐
cal transfer of endometrial particles. Manifestations in the spleen, lungs, kidneys, brain or skeleton are
rare.
Patient information – Causes of endometriosis
The causes of the development of endometriosis have not yet been scientifically proven. No
causal treatment options are, therefore, available at present which might enable endometriosis
to be eliminated completely or cured. There is also no treatment available that prevents en‐
dometriosis from developing in the first place.

2,"Preoperative treatment with the anti-TNFa antibody inﬂiximab
does not reduce pain symptoms or lesion volume in patients with
rectovaginal septum disease (LoE2). In the postoperative setting,
goserelin alone for 6 months is associated with a higher 2-year
recurrence rate than the combination of goserelin + anastrazole
(LoE2). A 6-month course of the selective oestrogen receptor
modulator raloxifene after complete surgical excision of endome-
triosis is associated with more rapid and more frequent recurrence
of pain symptoms than with placebo (LoE2).
Selective oestrogen receptor modulators are not recommended
after surgery for endometriosis (Grade B). In the absence of data,
aromatase inhibitors, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, selec-
tive progesterone receptor modulators, and TNFa inhibitors are not
recommended for managing endometriosis-related pain (Grade C).
The current data do not yet justify recommending elagolix for the
treatment of endometriosis-related pain outside the clinical trial
setting (Grade C).
These recommendations could be revised once the results of
ongoing clinical trials are available.
Hormonal therapy for endometriosis-related pain in
adolescents
In light of their efﬁcacy against dysmenorrhoea and endometriosis-
related pain in adults, and their tolerability, a CHC or low-dose
progestogen contraceptive is recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for
adolescents with endometriosis-related pain when not contraindica-
ted (Expert Consensus) [14]. If the ﬁrst-line strategy fails, the opinion
of a specialist is recommended in order to determine the best
diagnostic and treatment strategy to adopt (Expert Consensus).
Dienogest and GnRHas are effective against endometriosis-
related pain in adolescents (LoE2) [14].
Given the risks of bone demineralization, GnRHas are not
recommended for adolescent patients (Grade B). GnRHas must not
be prescribed before the age of 16 years (18 years of age according
to 
the 
marketing 
authorization).

Medical Management of Pain Associated
With Endometriosis
E
ndometriosis is a chronic and often progressive inflam-
matory condition of the pelvis whose predominant
symptom is pain. The overall amount of endometriosis is
not related to the frequency or severity of symptoms, and
the condition’s etiology remains unknown. Thus, by neces-
sity, medical therapy is non-specific and aimed at alleviating
symptoms. Since there is no cure, medical treatments must
be effective and safe to use until the age of menopause or
until pregnancy is desired. See Figure.
IS PRIOR LAPAROSCOPY REQUIRED?
Laparoscopy is not always necessary before medical man-
agement of pelvic pain is started. In women with severe
dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain that is compromising
their quality of life, management of the pain is required
whether or not endometriosis is the cause. Since all the
management strategies for endometriosis are relatively gen-
eral strategies to decrease inflammatory conditions in the
pelvis, the treatments are applicable to pelvic pain whether a
diagnosis of endometriosis is made or not.
The presence of endometriosis can be strongly suspected in
cases of severe dysmenorrhea unresponsive to NSAID
treatment, with pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation
of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum, or
with ultrasound documentation of an ovarian cyst with an
appearance typical of an endometrioma. In these situations,
laparoscopy for diagnosis is not necessary before medical
treatment. Laparoscopy should generally be performed only
if the surgeon is prepared to vaporize or excise lesions if
endometriosis is discovered, since there is good evidence
that surgical management provides long-term pain relief for
up to 50% of patients with endometriosis.1–3
COMBINED ESTROGEN AND PROGESTIN THERAPY
The use of oral contraceptives that combine estrogen and
progestin is considered first-line treatment for pelvic pain","What is the first-line treatment for pelvic pain?
",The use of oral contraceptives that combine estrogen and progestin is considered first-line treatment for pelvic pain.,SOGC-2010.pdf,3.0,"The context provides information about the medical management of pain associated with endometriosis, specifically the use of combined estrogen and progestin therapy as first-line treatment for pelvic pain. The question asks about the first-line treatment for pelvic pain in general, not just in the context of endometriosis. However, the context does not provide any information about other potential first-line treatments for pelvic pain that are not related to endometriosis. Therefore, while the context does provide an answer to the question, it is not a comprehensive answer that covers all possible causes of pelvic pain. Based on this reasoning, I would rate the total rating as a 3.
",4.0,"This question is useful for gynecologists diagnosing endometriosis, planning a endometriosis therapy or treating a patient with endometriosis, as pelvic pain is a common symptom of endometriosis. The first-line treatment for pelvic pain can vary depending on the cause, and endometriosis is one of the possible causes.

4,"For assessing the effectiveness of treatments, the Committee identified pain relief, health-
related quality of life (QoL) and adverse events as critical outcomes for which NMA could be 
used to aid decision-making. NMAs were performed on these outcomes where evidence was 
available.  
Pain relief 
For pain relief, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was considered by the Committee to be the 
most widely used useful pain scale for which data would be available. A series of subscales 
first reported by Biberoglu and Behrman (1981) were also frequently used in studies of 
hormonal treatments and NMAs of these subscales were also performed to provide 
additional information on pain relief. There was sufficient evidence available for NMA for 
dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and non-menstrual pelvic pain subscales, though not for 
induration and pelvic tenderness subscales. Therefore induration and pelvic tenderness were 
analysed within a separate pairwise comparison analysis. Dysmenorrhoea and non-
menstrual pelvic pain were used in a multivariate analysis to inform the VAS scale, so their 
results are not presented separately here. 
Health-related QoL  
For health-related QoL, the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) was determined by the 
Committee to the most useful scale that was widely used in the literature. However, there 
were not a sufficient number of studies available from the systematic review to allow for 
NMA. Therefore these studies were analysed within the separate pairwise comparison 
analysis where appropriate.","What scale was used to measure health-related QoL?
",The Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36),NICE-2017.pdf,1.0,"The context provides information about the methods used to measure pain relief, but it does not provide any information about the scale used to measure health-related QoL. The context only mentions that the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) was determined by the Committee to be the most useful scale for measuring health-related QoL, but it does not provide any information about the scale itself. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question unambiguously with the given context.
",3.0,"This question is useful for understanding the methodology of the study and the validity of the results. If the health-related QoL was measured using a non-standardized or non-validated scale, the results may not be comparable to other studies or may not accurately reflect the patients' actual QoL.

The option of a research recommendation was discussed but the Committee agreed that this 
methodology would never be specific enough to diagnose endometriosis and therefore 
further research would, most likely, not provide evidence that would support a positive or 
negative recommendation for this.

Key conclusions 
The Committee decided not to make a recommendation or a research recommendation 
based on their discussion about PGP 9.5. This is mainly due to the fact that this methodology 
in not specific as a diagnostic tool to detect endometriosis. It was agreed that as a method of 
testing it requires standardisation in methodology, it is not routinely used in current practice, 
it is not conclusively validated and utilised in most laboratories and is expensive.

Introduction  
MRI is a non-invasive test for the diagnosis of endometriosis and, if it is accurate, it could 
lead to the diagnosis without the need for a surgical procedure or it could decrease the need 
for it.  
The aim of this review was to evaluate the accuracy of MRI for the diagnosis of 
endometriosis in women with suspected endometriosis.  
For full details see review protocol in Appendix D. 
9.4.2 
Description of clinical evidence 
Two studies were included in this review. Evidence was available from 1 Cochrane 
systematic review (Nisenblat 2016) and 1 observational study (Arrive 1989). Seventeen 
studies within the Cochrane systematic review were relevant (Abrao 2007, Ascher 1995,

",4.0,"MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to diagnose endometriosis. Its accuracy is reported to be around 75-90% in detecting endometriosis. However, the accuracy can vary depending on the severity of the disease, the location of the lesions, and the expertise of the radiologist interpreting the images. Therefore, MRI can be a useful tool in diagnosing endometriosis, but it should not be relied upon as the sole method of diagnosis.

pharmacologic agents proportional to the level of pain reported. The initial step uses oral 
administration of non-opioids such as paracetamol or NSAIDs. If pain is not controlled, then 
mild opioids such as codeine are tried and, as a last step, strong opioids such as morphine 
are used until the patient’s pain is alleviated. One benefit of the stepped approach is that 
adverse events can be discovered throughout the process.  
The Committee discussed whether the addition of an opioid analgesic could be considered if 
pain was not adequately controlled after a trial period. However, the potential adverse effects 
of opioid analgesia, such as dependency, were recognised, given the chronic nature of 
endometriosis-related pain and, particularly, constipation. Therefore, the Committee 
concluded that a referral for diagnosis might be more appropriate and that there were other 
treatment options available.  
The Committee also considered whether a research recommendation should be drafted for 
this topic. They agreed that research into analgesia in the management of pain related to 
endometriosis is not a priority for this guideline because there is sufficient indirect evidence 
from other conditions available to draw upon. 
The Committee considered whether any different recommendations were necessary for 
adolescent women but concluded that none were required.

All participants had a diagnosis or symptoms of endometriosis. One RCT examined a 
comparison of a GnRH agonist (buserelin intranasal (IN)) to expectant management in a 
population of women whose main symptom was infertility and who had undergone diagnostic 
laparoscopy combined with dilation and curettage (D&C) (Fedele 1993).  
Two RCTs examined comparisons of GnRH agonists to placebo (triptorelin IM 
(intramuscular) depot and leuprolide IM depot) (Bergqvist 1998 and Ling 1999, respectively). 
One RCT compared a combined oral contraceptive pill to placebo (Harada 2008).  
Evidence was only available for the critical outcome of pain (outcomes not included in the 
NMAs). There was no evidence available for any other critical or important outcomes. 
Hormonal treatment compared with another hormonal treatment 
Evidence was available from 2 studies comparing a hormonal treatment to another hormonal 
treatment. One was a Cochrane systematic review (Brown 2010) and one was a RCT 
(Schlaff 2006). Four RCTs within the Cochrane systematic review were relevant (Burry 1992, 
Cheng 2005, Fedele 1989, Petta 2005).  
Three RCTs examined a comparison of a GnRH agonist (nafarelin IN or buserelin IN) to 
danazol (Burry 1992, Cheng 2005, Fedele 1989). One RCT compared leuprolide IM to a 
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) to (Petta 2010) and 1 RCT compared 
leuprolide to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) subcutaneous (SC) injections 
(Schlaff 2006). All participants had laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. One trial 
(Fedele 1989) included infertile women only. 
Evidence was available for the critical outcomes of pain (outcomes not included in the NMA) 
and quality of life, and for the important outcomes of patients requiring surgery because of 
reappearance of symptoms and the effect on daily activities. There was no evidence 
available for any other important outcomes.","What is the main symptom of the population in the RCT that compared a GnRH agonist to expectant management?

ductive tract and other organ systems, it is dubious whether agents
used for their anti-angiogenic properties (including cabergoline, endo-
statin, sirolimus, thalidomide and vascular endothelial growth factor
inhibitors) will be useful clinically and these have been used only in
animal research to date (Laschke and Menger, 2012).

Complementary therapies may help women to cope better with their
endometriosis and its treatment and are supported by some evidence
from RCTs.

and safe but requires repeated treatments (Zhu et al., 2011). High-

9.5.7.6 
Key conclusions 
The Committee concluded that laparoscopy should be considered in women with symptoms 
of endometriosis even when imaging has given a normal result. A negative finding following a 
thorough laparoscopic visualisation is highly specific and women can be reassured that they 
do not have endometriosis. Histological examination of biopsied tissue is considered to be a 
gold standard test and helpful to confirm the visual diagnosis; it is also required to exclude 
malignancy if ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma) is fenestrated and ablated. 
9.5.8 
Recommendations 
Also refer to section 11.3.5 on surgical management, and section 12.3.4 on surgical 
management if fertility is a priority.  
25. Consider laparoscopy to diagnose endometriosis in women with suspected 
endometriosis, even if the ultrasound was normal. 
26. For women with suspected deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder or 
ureter, consider a pelvic ultrasound or MRI before an operative laparoscopy.  
27. During a diagnostic laparoscopy, a gynaecologist with training and skills in 
laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis should perform a systematic inspection 
of the pelvis. 
28. During a diagnostic laparoscopy, consider taking a biopsy of suspected 
endometriosis:  
 to confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis (be aware that a negative 
histological result does not exclude endometriosis)","How can a woman be reassured that she does not have endometriosis?
",A negative finding following a thorough laparoscopic visualisation is highly specific and women can be reassured that they do not have endometriosis.,NICE-2017.pdf,1.0,"The context provides information about the diagnostic process for endometriosis, including the use of laparoscopy and biopsy. However, it does not provide any information about how a woman can be reassured that she does not have endometriosis. The context focuses on diagnostic methods, not reassurance methods. Therefore, I would rate this a 1 out of 5 for unambiguously answering the question with the given context.
",3.0,"This question is useful for patients who are worried about having endometriosis but have not been diagnosed with it yet. It can help them understand what they can do to alleviate their concerns. However, it is important to note that the only way to definitively diagnose endometriosis is through a laparoscopy, so reassuring a woman that she does not have endometriosis without this procedure is not possible.

uncommon to ﬁnd advanced stage endometriosis in an
asymptomatic woman (with a normal ultrasound), there is
low utility in performing laparoscopy in asymptomatic
women. When laparoscopy is performed, ablation or excision
of visible endometriosis should be considered based on Level I
evidence. This should be discussed openly with the patient
when planning her treatment. Expectant management after
laparoscopy is an option for younger women. Alternatively,

The Committee agreed with the output of the health economic model that hormonal 
treatment was likely to be the most cost-effective first-line treatment for endometriosis. 
Hormonal treatments are so effective that they can be prescribed without any confirmatory 
testing, although the Committee discussed how such testing might be useful anyway for 
reasons unrelated to symptom control (for example, to ensure that the lesions were not

In terms of diagnostic test accuracy reviews (see chapter 8), 1 systematic literature search 
was carried out for all index tests listed in the review protocol. The resulting titles and 
abstracts were then sifted for all index tests generating: 
 included studies for each index test; and 
 a single excluded studies list for all studies that were not included in any of the diagnostic 
reviews. 
4.3 Reviewing research evidence 
4.3.1 
Types of studies and inclusion and exclusion criteria 
For most intervention reviews in this guideline, parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
were prioritised because they are considered the most robust type of study design that could 
produce an unbiased estimate of the intervention effects.  
For diagnostic reviews, cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective observational studies 
were considered for inclusion. For prognostic reviews, prospective and retrospective cohort 
studies were included. Case-control studies were not considered for inclusion. 
In the qualitative review, studies using focus groups, or structured or semi-structured 
interviews were considered for inclusion. Survey data or other types of questionnaires were 
only included if they provided analysis from open-ended questions, but not if they reported 
descriptive quantitative data only. 
Where data from observational studies were included, the Committee decided that the 
results for each outcome should be presented separately for each study and meta-analysis 
was not conducted. 
The evidence was reviewed following the steps shown schematically in Figure 2: 
 Potentially relevant studies were identified for each review question from the relevant 
search results by reviewing titles and abstracts. Full papers were then obtained 
 Full papers were reviewed against pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify","What type of studies were considered for inclusion in the diagnostic reviews?

PMPs are well established as interventions for people with chronic pain 
conditions, to minimise the physical disability and psychological distress

36,"In certain situations, cystectomy for endometrioma can lead to partial
or total oophorectomy due to intraoperative difﬁculties. In the absence
of cleavage planes, it is best to abandon cystectomy if the patient
wishes to preserve the ovary (Expert Consensus).
Isolated ovarian endometrioma is very rare (LoE3). The risk of
recurrence is increased after incomplete surgery (LoE3). Evaluation for
and treatment of other pelvic locations of endometriosis are
recommended when an endometrioma is discovered or during its
surgical management (Grade C). Neither expectant management nor
ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration is recommended as ﬁrst-line
management for women with pain (Grade C) due to the risk of
persistence or rapid recurrence of pain and endometriomas (LoE3).
Ethanol sclerotherapy is associated with a lower cyst recurrence rate
than aspiration alone (LoE3) and can therefore be offered to patients
with recurrent endometriomas (Expert Consensus). Ablation of
endometriomas with bipolar coagulation is not recommended (Grade
B) due to lower postoperative pregnancy rates and higher rates of
recurrence of endometrioma (LoE1).
Laser or plasma energy ablation cannot be recommended over
cystectomy due to the lack of high-quality evidence from
comparative studies [16].

bladder by partial cystectomy has long-term efﬁcacy against pain
symptoms and the risk of recurrence, and has a low rate of severe

Committee agreed with the evidence and further highlighted that the benefit from hormonal 
treatments was due to their efficacy in stopping or reducing periods. There was a desire from 
the Committee to reduce the number of repeated operations for women with endometriosis, 
further supporting maintenance of pain relief using hormonal treatments wherever possible.  
Although they chose not to be specific about recommending a particular hormonal treatment 
in the recommendations, they stated that the first-line hormonal treatment would generally be 
the oral combined contraceptive pill or progestogens as they have good efficacy and typically 
have side effects that women may find more tolerable. The evidence showed that cyclic use 
of the combined oral contraceptive pill is effective, but the Committee were also aware that 
continuous and tricycling (where three packets are taken in a row, followed by a pill free 
interval) use of the pill are used in clinical practice, and although evidence was not available 
on these regimens in the literature, the Committee have found in their experience that these 
were also effective with limited adverse events. 
The Committee recommended that if first-line hormonal treatment was contraindicated or not 
tolerated, then women should be referred to a gynaecologist for possible further treatment 
which could include other hormonal treatments (for example, with a GnRH-a) or surgery. The 
Committee discussed the results of clinical effectiveness of other hormonal treatments such 
as GnRH-as and danazol. Even though highly effective, use of GnRH-as requires guidance 
from a specialist as the NMA showed that they had higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse 
events and the Committee identified them as having more serious adverse events (e.g. bone 
density changes). The Committee noted that GnRH-as are only licensed for a 6 month period","What is the first-line hormonal treatment for endometriosis?

38,"atrophy of the endometrial tissue is the proposed mechanism
of action (60). Whereas combined OCs containing the more
androgenic progestogens (19-nortestosterone derivatives)
traditionally have been used to treat endometriosis symp-
toms, combined OCs containing the new generation progesto-
gen, desogestrel, also have proven effective (61). A low-dose
combined OC administered in a cyclic regimen to women with
endometriosis was found as effective as GnRH-a treatment for
relief of dyspareunia and nonmenstrual pain as assessed by a
pain scoring system (62). However, GnRH-a treatment was
more effective than combined OCs for the relief of dysmenor-
rhea because the agonist reliably induces amenorrhea (62). A
prospective observational trial demonstrated that continuous
low-dose combined OCs were more effective than cyclic com-
bined OCs in controlling endometriosis symptoms in patients
after surgical treatment for endometriosis (63).
Progestogens
Progestogens most commonly used for the treatment of endo-
metriosis include medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and
19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., levonorgestrel, norethin-
drone acetate, and dienogest). As with OCs, their proposed
mechanism of action involves decidualization and subse-
quent atrophy of endometrial tissue. Another more recently
proposed mechanism involves progestogen-induced suppres-
sion of matrix metalloproteinases, a class of enzymes impor-
tant in the growth and implantation of ectopic endometrium
(60). Inhibition of angiogenesis has also been proposed as a
mechanism to explain the effectiveness of progestins in the
treatment of endometriosis (64). In observational studies
involving treatment with MPA, dydrogesterone, or norethin-
drone acetate, pain has been reduced by 70%–100% (65). A

trials

OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
Similar results were seen in a more recent study of 
120 patients who underwent excision of the endome-
triosis and hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy 
(99). These patients were monitored for a median dura-
tion of 7.6–11 years. Most patients did not require reop-
eration, even with conservation of the ovaries. Therefore, 
in patients with normal ovaries, a hysterectomy with ovar-
ian conservation and removal of the endometriotic lesions 
should be considered. 
 Can patients have recurrent symptoms after 
hysterectomy and oophorectomy?
Symptoms may recur in women even after hysterec-
tomy and oophorectomy. Endometriosis may recur in 
up to 15% of women whether or not the patients are 
treated with estrogen therapy after bilateral oopho-
rectomy (124). Consequently, hormone therapy with 
estrogen is not contraindicated after definitive surgery 
for endometriosis. Although the true rate of recurrence
is unknown, in patients with recurrent symptoms under-
going a surgical procedure, endometriotic lesions may 
be demonstrated. The most common site of recurrent
lesions is the large and small bowel (125). These 
lesions were likely present at the time of surgery and 
not excised. These lesions can be considered persistent 
disease rather than recurrent disease. Persistence of dis-
ease in hypoestrogenic states is most likely due to local 
expression of aromatase activity. Treatment is difficult 
and often requires surgery. The use of a GnRH agonist 
in this situation of hypoestrogenemia would not seem to 
be of benefit. Aromatase inhibitors may be considered 
but are not uniformly effective (126).
 What is the role of hormone therapy after 
definitive surgery for endometriosis-associated 
pain?
Currently, there are limited data on the timing of estro-
gen therapy after hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy for endometriosis. It appears there is no","Can endometriosis recur after hysterectomy and oophorectomy?

It mentions that symptoms may recur in women after hysterectomy and oophorectomy, but it does not specify whether endometriosis itself can recur.
